#Accuracy and Precision:
####Accuracy: Accuracy refers to how closely a computed or measured value agress with the true value.
####Precision: Precision referst to how closely individual computed or measured values agree with each other.


Error = True value - Approximation

True value = Error + Approximation

Approximation = True value - Error

True fractional relative error = True error / True value

True percent relative error = ( True error / True value ) * 100%

##Problem: Suppose that you have the task of measuring, the length of a bridge and rivet and come up with *9,999cm* and *9cm* respectively. If the true values are *10,000cm* and *10cm* respectively. Compute 1. The true error and 2. The true percent relative error for each case

##Solution:
  1. For bridge,
  
      Ea = 10000 - 9999 = 1cm
      
     For rivet,
     
      Ea = 10 - 9 = 1cm
      
  2. For bridge,
  
      Ea = ( 1 / 10000 ) * 100% = 0.01%
      
     For rivet,
     
      Ea = ( 1 / 10 ) * 100% = 10%
