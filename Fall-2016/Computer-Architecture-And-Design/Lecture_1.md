###Computer Architecture

Computer architecture is about selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create a computer
that meet functional perfomance of cost goals.

Computer Architecture refers to instruction set design and implementation.

* The Term Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) refers to the actual programmer visible instruction set. It
  serves as the boundary of softaware and hardware.
 
* Implementation of machine has two components:
 * Organization - includes the high level aspects of computer design. Such as memory system, bus structure.
 
 * Hardware - refers to the specifics of a machine, including the detailed logic design and packaging technology 
   of the machine.

###Task of a Computer Designer

* Determine the attributes that are important for the new machine.
* Design a machine to maximize to performance while staying within cost constraints and power constraints.
* Some important design aspects:
 * Instruction set design
 * Functional organization
 * Logic design
 * Implementation
